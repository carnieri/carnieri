## Previous commands

2024-05-04

In a shell, you can easily see the previous commands you entered and fix any mistakes. In a GUI, however, you can't see what was done previously.

Automation is also much simpler in the shell. Why is that? I think it's because in GUIs there isn't a language to manipulate actions.
