## Gamification considered harmful

2023-05-30

Maybe gamification in things like apps is not a good thing for the user. In the long term, the user loses the ability to create internal or intrinsic reward systems, and instead becomes dependent on the external rewards of the app. Perhaps the external rewards even hijack the initial motivation the person had for attempting to learn that skill.

Perfect example: Duolingo.
