## The author's premises

2024-10-26

When critically reading a text, try to extract the author's implicit premises.

E.g. if the author criticizes a person for being rich, there is a premise that in the process of getting rich hurts others (zero sum). There is the premise that that person didn't create value for other in order to get rich, or even stole value from others.
