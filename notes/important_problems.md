## Important problems

Last update: 2024-12-06

Please don't say "AI safety". I find that worry ridiculous. The real problem is bad actors using AI for nefarious deeds.

### Concepts

- Impact per dollar. If you want to fix a problem, you'll want to do it in a way that is cheap and has a lot of impact.

### 1. Energy storage

### 2. Basic sanitation and clean water access


### 3. Poverty

Instead of asking "what is poverty?", it's more illuminating to ask "what is wealth?". There are many kinds of wealth. First, whatever a person values, that is wealth to them.
- A place to live in is wealth. The more convenient and comfortable the place, the wealthier you are.
- Access to clean water is wealth.
- Eating nutritious food is wealth.
- Being healthy is wealth. Access to healthcare is wealth.
- Having clothes to wear is wealth. Those clothes being clean is wealth.
- Clean air to breath is wealth.
- Being safe from violence is wealth.
- Education is wealth.
- Free time is wealth.
- Leisure is wealth.
- Being able to choose what you do is wealth. Being able to choose your profession is wealth. Having the option of changing jobs is wealth.
- Having friends and family is wealth.
- Access to beauty is wealth.
- A fulfilling life is wealth.

As we can see, the concept of wealth is very broad and permeates all aspects of life.

Not having any of the items in the list above, or many other items as well, is lack of wealth. The less you have of those things, the poorer you are.

If a person doesn't have one of those things, and wants to have it, then getting it makes her wealthier.

In other words, wealth is created when more people have more of their needs satisfied, all other things being equal. [1]

It's clear that wealth is subjective, because different people value different things. But people share the same basic needs, so satisfying those is sure to make them wealthier.

#### Invert

When does a person get poorer? When one of her wants or needs ceases to be satisfied, or becomes less satisfied. If you lose your house in a fire, you are poorer. If you get sick, you are poorer. If your dish washer breaks and you have to spend more time washing the dishes, you are poorer.


[1] No wealth is created if a person improves one aspect of her life at the cost of something that she considers more important. Or at someone else's cost. In fact, that might result in the destruction of wealth.

### Questions

But what is the difference between wealth and simply "getting what you want"?


What is the research on effective methods that increase wealth?

Here are some ideas:
1. Premature deaths have a high cost to society. It's in everyone's interest that other people flourish.
2.
