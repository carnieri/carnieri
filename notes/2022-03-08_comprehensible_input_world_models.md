## Comprehensible input for building world models

2022-03-08

I've recently been reading about comprehensible input in language learning. What about comprehensible input for building world models (common sense)? How is it that all infants learn the same basic facts about the world: object permanence, container-object relationships, momentum, gravity, etc?

LeCun: common sense is a collection of world models.

LeCun: self-supervised learning, but where prediction takes place not on the pixel level (e.g. for video prediction), but at a higher level.

\#idea Maybe discrete symbols have a role in this?

Bengio: the world model has to be structured - independence of variables (?), necessary for out-of-distribution generalization.

discrete attention

discrete decisions
