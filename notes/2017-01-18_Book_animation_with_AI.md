## Book animation with AI

2017-01-18

Idea: A deep learning system that progressively draws a scene as it reads sentences from a book. It starts with a white canvas, then reads about a river, so it draws a river; then reads about a girl crossing the river, so it draws that. The whole process is an animation.
